# Training launchers

These entrypoints are available to repository clones and are not included in
the installed `plasmax` distribution. Run them from the repository root with
`uv run python training/<name>.py --help`.

| Entrypoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `train_ppo.py` | Train an upstream Rejax PPO policy through the thin Envelope/Gymnax adapter. |
| `train_sac.py` | Train an upstream Rejax SAC policy through the same adapter. |
| `train_backprop.py` | Train a feedback policy or open-loop knot schedule through native Envelope gradients. |
| `train_mpc.py` | Train an online dynamics model and save its frozen MPC planner. |

This directory also contains shared training and evaluation utilities. The
algorithms live in `agents/`; research studies and publication plotting live
under `experiments/`. Generic evaluation and rollout commands remain in
[scripts/](../scripts/README.md).

New runs default to the `realistic` research label, which selects
`RealisticWrappers(make(...))`; `oracle` selects `OracleWrappers`. The launchers
inherit the reward from task YAML metadata unless explicitly overridden.
Termination shaping belongs to the reward function. Wrapper options are passed
to the composition helper. Training
defaults to online W&B logging.

All agents expose `train(rng) -> (state, results)` and `make_act(state)`. Backprop
and MPC use native Envelope training; PPO/SAC use upstream Rejax. Whole training
can be jitted and vmapped across seeds with the same static configuration.
TGLFNN training seeds must run as separate single-seed processes.

Evaluation callbacks log `evaluation/nonfinite_reward_rate` over valid rollout
transitions. This diagnostic does not replace nonfinite rewards, stop execution,
or inspect training rewards.

Every training launcher saves one inference-only MessagePack policy per seed.
Files default to unique paths under `outputs/policies`; `--checkpoint-dir`
selects a directory with run/seed filenames. The files include the inference
architecture, parameters, normalizers, interface, and run metadata, rather than
optimizer or replay state. Loading does not need a training-state template or an
environment. There is no legacy checkpoint reader or training-resumption API.

```python
import jax

from agents.policy_io import load_policy, save_policy

state, results = jax.jit(agent.train)(rng)
path = save_policy(agent, state, results=results, metadata=run_metadata)
policy = load_policy(path)
print(policy.summary())
act = policy.make_act()  # Uses the recorded deterministic/stochastic mode.
```

```bash
uv run python training/train_backprop.py --mode open_loop --env.variant realistic
uv run python training/train_mpc.py --env.variant realistic
```
