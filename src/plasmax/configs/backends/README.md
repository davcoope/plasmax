# Backends

A TORAX **backend** is deliberately narrow: it selects the turbulent transport
model and its model-specific guards, the solver and its fixed-duration substep
budget, and uncertainty ranges specific to that transport model. It is combined
with an **env** (the RL task — actuators, observations, geometry, scenario) at
load time via `make(env, backend)`. Shared physics and numerics live in
the tokamak/scenario/phase layers, so changing a backend does not silently
change the rest of the simulated plant. The backend supplies orthogonal backend
fields; environment composition follows
`tokamak < scenario base < phase < wrappers`. Not every env pairs with every
backend, and unsupported registered
pairs are rejected before construction.

Every registered backend YAML is a raw, backend-owned TORAX fragment rather
than an independently validated config. It is combined with an environment first; only
the resulting complete `PlasmaxConfig` is validated. Each file's header comment
documents its full parameter set and rationale; this README covers only the
**differences** between them. KSTAR instead validates one standalone
learned-world-model config.

## Current baseline

**Bohm–GyroBohm is the baseline for training and rollout for now:** use
`bohm_gyrobohm` for ITER/SPARC and the explicit `bohm_gyrobohm_step` calibration
for STEP. It is fast, differentiable, and robust under exploratory policies. It
is a controlled baseline rather than a claim that Bohm–GyroBohm is the
highest-fidelity transport model. Reported results should be cross-checked on
QLKNN and TGLFNN, and selected reference cases should be checked with the
nonlinear solver or an offline higher-fidelity model.

ITER and SPARC environment aliases always include an explicit `rampup`,
`flattop`, or `rampdown` phase. A different transport model is always an
explicit backend choice; models in the same category are alternatives, not
effects that are added together.

Upstream TORAX reference examples live at
https://github.com/google-deepmind/torax/tree/main/torax/examples. The most
relevant files for these backends are `iterhybrid_predictor_corrector.py`,
`iterhybrid_rampup.py`, and `step_flattop_bgb.py`.

## Two axes: transport model × solver

A TORAX backend is essentially a choice on two independent axes.

### Transport model — how turbulent heat/particle fluxes are computed

| Model | Type | Physics | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| **CGM** | analytic, theory-based | ITG critical-gradient (Guo–Romanelli); gyro-Bohm scaling with a critical-threshold nonlinearity | Fast, differentiable, no out-of-distribution (OOD) risk — a useful analytic cross-check on the default. |
| **QLKNN** | ML surrogate | NN (`qlknn_7_11_v1`) trained on QuaLiKiz; ITG + TEM + ETG modes | High fidelity but valid only inside its training range; an exploring policy can drive it OOD, so inner/outer patches + chi/D/V clipping guard against runaway fluxes. |
| **TGLFNN-UKAEA** | ML surrogate | NN surrogate of TGLF (Trapped-Gyro-Landau-Fluid) | Independent high-fidelity check on the QuaLiKiz-lineage QLKNN. Conventional and STEP-trained weights are selected by explicit backend files. |
| **Bohm–GyroBohm (BgB)** | analytic, semi-empirical | Bohm + gyro-Bohm turbulent transport | **Current baseline.** Geometry-agnostic TORAX model with an explicit OpenSTEP-calibrated STEP backend. |

All ITER/SPARC backends inherit the same conventional tokamak stack: **Redl
bootstrap current, Sauter conductivity, and Angioni–Sauter neoclassical
transport**. The common adaptive-transport pedestal uses prescribed targets and
Martin L–H formation; common numerics, timestep settings, and backend-independent
physics randomization are inherited from the same conventional base. CGM does
not select a different neoclassical model. STEP owns its corresponding common
neoclassical, pedestal, numerical, and randomization stack in `tokamaks/step.yaml`.

### Solver — how the coupled transport PDEs are advanced each step

| Solver | How | Cost | When |
|--------|-----|------|------|
| **linear** (theta-method + predictor–corrector) | Fixed-point: freeze coefficients at the previous iterate, solve the linear system, repeat `n_corrector_steps` times | Cheap per step; vectorises cleanly under `vmap` | Default for RL training/rollout. Lower accuracy over stiff transients. |
| **newton_raphson** | Gradient-based; JAX auto-diffs the Jacobian, iterates residual → 0, with line search + adaptive `dt` fallback | Model-dependent; can exceed 100× linear cost when differentiating an NN transport model on CPU. **Serialises poorly under `vmap`** (every vmapped env blocks on the slowest one's Newton iterations). | Highly nonlinear/stiff cases where linear convergence is inadequate. |
| **optimizer** | Recasts the PDE residual as a loss, minimised via jaxopt | Similar to NR | TORAX flags it "relatively untested" — not used by any backend here. |

`solver_type` accepts `linear`, `newton_raphson`, or `optimizer`. Training
backends use the linear solver with predictor-corrector iterations;
`tglfnn_nr.yaml` is the packaged nonlinear reference for fidelity checks.

### Fixed-duration control steps

`torax.numerics.fixed_dt` is the external RL control interval, not a promise
that TORAX will accept one PDE solve of that size. A transition holds its
action and randomized runtime provider fixed while completing the interval
with bounded internal solves. `stepping.max_solver_substeps` is normally
backend-owned (`1` by default and `32` for `tglfnn_nr`), while a scenario
with sawtooth MHD sets `stepping.max_event_substeps: 1`; the disjoint settings
are combined.
Both limits are static and changing either recompiles the JAX transition.

Transition info exposes `internal_steps`, `sawtooth_crashes`,
`control_step_complete`, and `step_limit_reached`. Exhaustion or a failed solve
with otherwise finite values terminates with code `3` at its actual partial
time; a successful transition lands exactly on the configured control grid.
After each internal step, NaN or infinity in checked profiles or critical
outputs (including `P_cyclotron_e`, `P_SOL_total`, and `P_LH`) stops advancement
with code `4` (`INVALID_STATE`). Nonfinite observations or the checked
Greenwald value also produce code `4`, which takes precedence over code `3` and
physical disruption codes. Built-in rewards return zero for invalid states.
Final rewards are cast to float32 without a finiteness assertion. Evaluation
logging reports nonfinite rewards separately from invalid physical states.

All solvers use **Pereverzev–Corrigan artificial diffusion**
(`use_pereverzev`, `chi_pereverzev`, `D_pereverzev`): a large artificial
diffusion term balanced by an inward convection term so that *zero* net
transport is added at time *t*. It stabilises stiff turbulent transport (QLKNN,
TGLFNN, CGM) at the cost of accuracy over short transients.

## The backends

| File | Transport | Solver | Env family | One-liner |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| `cgm.yaml` | CGM | linear | ITER/SPARC | Fast analytic alternative and robustness cross-check (~5 s compile, ~15 ms/step). |
| `qlknn.yaml` | QLKNN | linear | ITER/SPARC | ML-fidelity transport, cheap solver — preferred for vectorised QLKNN rollouts/training. |
| `bohm_gyrobohm.yaml` | Bohm–GyroBohm | linear | ITER/SPARC | Generic BgB training/rollout baseline. |
| `bohm_gyrobohm_step.yaml` | Bohm–GyroBohm | linear | STEP | Complete STEP-specific BgB backend with its OpenSTEP transport calibration. |
| `tglfnn.yaml` | TGLFNN-UKAEA | linear | ITER/SPARC | Conventional TGLFNN on the cheap solver; independent check on QLKNN. |
| `tglfnn_nr.yaml` | TGLFNN-UKAEA | Newton-Raphson | ITER/SPARC | Nonlinear reference backend; realistic runs share the linear TGLF backend's transport uncertainty, while oracle runs remain nominal and deterministic. |
| `tglfnn_spherical.yaml` | TGLFNN-UKAEA | linear | STEP | STEP-trained TGLFNN weights on the fixed-cost linear solver; the common STEP plant stack remains tokamak-owned. |
| `mock.yaml` | Constant | linear | Mock smoke environment | Minimal nonphysical backend for fast configuration and pipeline tests. |

The three TGLFNN files extend the private `tglfnn_base.yaml` fragment.
That fragment is packaging-only configuration reuse, not a registered backend;
each public backend still resolves to the same complete TORAX mapping.

## Physics coverage

TORAX exposes a menu of modular physics. One geometry and one turbulent
transport model are selected per run, while compatible source terms are summed.
The table describes the resolved main-environment stacks; `mock/circular/smoke` instead
uses circular geometry with the `mock` constant-transport backend, and
`experiments/studies/reproduce_torax_paper_case.py` is a separate CHEASE
reference case.

| Physics area | Current use | Important limitation |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Magnetic geometry | Time-keyed EQDSK equilibria for ITER/SPARC; IMAS equilibrium for STEP | No self-consistent equilibrium solve; FBT is unused and CHEASE is reference-only. |
| Composition and evolved profiles | D–T main-ion mix plus one impurity mixture; evolving Ti, Te, ne, and psi | ITER/SPARC currently use Ne as the single impurity and prescribe Zeff. Heavy-impurity transport is not modelled. |
| Turbulent transport | Default BgB; optional CGM, QLKNN, and TGLFNN-UKAEA | Surrogates need OOD guards; BgB/CGM require calibration and do not reproduce all gyrokinetic effects. |
| Neoclassical physics | Redl bootstrap, Sauter conductivity, and Angioni–Sauter transport shared by every ITER/SPARC backend; STEP has one corresponding tokamak-owned stack | These are common plant assumptions, not transport-backend ablations. |
| Pedestal and L–H transition | Tokamak-owned `set_T_ped_n_ped`/Martin/adaptive-transport semantics with scenario-owned targets | This is not a predictive ELMy-H pedestal model. `ADAPTIVE_SOURCE` is rejected because it can inject unreported heat and particles; pedestal targets are enforced through transport instead. |
| Auxiliary heating/current | Gaussian generic heat/current plus Gaussian Lin–Liu ECCD | ITER NBI and SPARC ICRF are deposition approximations, not dedicated source solvers. |
| Particle sources | Gas puff plus generic Gaussian source for ITER/SPARC; pellet model for STEP | Deposition is prescribed rather than coupled to neutral/pellet ablation physics. |
| Core heat sources | Bosch–Hale D–T fusion, ion–electron heat exchange, and ohmic heating for ITER/SPARC/STEP | Ohmic uses the standard resistive model wherever current is evolved. |
| Radiation | Relativistic bremsstrahlung, Mavrin impurity radiation, and Albajar cyclotron radiation, all tokamak-owned for ITER/SPARC; STEP keeps its OpenSTEP lumped-radiation sink | Cyclotron wall-reflection coefficient is the TORAX default (0.9), not machine-calibrated. |
| Rotation | Disabled on TGLFNN and not configured for QLKNN | No calibrated toroidal-rotation input or momentum evolution in the scenarios. |
| Edge/divertor | No coupled edge model | TORAX's Extended Lengyel model is not enabled. |
| Fast ions and ICRH | Fusion-power partitioning only | ToricNN/scaled-profile ICRH, fast-ion pressure/dilution, and ITG stabilization are not enabled. |
| MHD | Disruption termination plus TORAX's simple sawtooth trigger/redistribution in ITER baseline/hybrid and both SPARC scenarios. Inner-core transport patches remain surrogate OOD guards, not crash models. | Sawtooth crashes are internal event substeps inside one fixed-duration control transition. ITER advanced and STEP intentionally have no sawtooth model; QLKNN's proxy stays off because it is not a physical substitute. NTMs are not modelled. |

## Where physics configuration belongs

The merge precedence is, from lowest to highest:

`tokamak < scenario base < phase < wrappers`

The backend is orthogonal to that chain and supplies disjoint transport,
solver, solver-budget, and model-specific randomization fields.

Use the narrowest layer that owns the physics:

- **Backend:** transport implementation, transport-specific corrections and
  bounds, solver implementation and settings, fixed-duration solver budget, and
  `transport_model.*` uncertainty. A backend must not choose neoclassical,
  pedestal, source, radiation, or common numerical assumptions.
- **Conventional tokamak base:** the common ITER/SPARC Redl/Sauter/
  Angioni–Sauter stack, adaptive-transport Martin pedestal, timestep and common
  numerical settings, and backend-independent physics randomization.
- **Machine tokamak (`tokamaks/iter.yaml`, `tokamaks/sparc.yaml`):** geometry
  plumbing, composition, wall/edge constants, source-model choices, disruption
  limits, and the RL interface that are valid for every scenario on that
  machine. `tokamaks/step.yaml` owns the corresponding full common STEP stack.
- **Scenario base (`envs/<tokamak>/<scenario>/base.yaml`):** discharge-specific
  Zeff, source powers and deposition, minority fractions, pedestal targets, and
  other physics shared by ramp-up, flat-top, and ramp-down.
- **Phase YAML:** phase schedules, boundary conditions, geometry sequence,
  horizon, an `initialization` asset reference, and phase-specific overrides.
- **Initialization YAML (`data/initializations/`):** complete resolved profiles,
  confinement mode, smoothed energy history, and provenance. STEP also stores
  composition at cell and face locations. These arrays are applied after merging
  configuration layers. They never inherit radial points from scenario bases.

For SPARC specifically, conventional models shared with ITER come from the
conventional tokamak base; SPARC-only machine settings common to PRD and
reduced-field operation live in `tokamaks/sparc.yaml`. Their operating points
belong in `envs/sparc/prd/base.yaml` and
`envs/sparc/reduced_field/base.yaml`. Zeff, radiation multipliers, ICRH power,
minority concentration, and pedestal targets remain scenario-level. Deep merge
therefore keeps a backend comparison confined to transport and solver.

## Fidelity roadmap

These are proposed additions, not validated defaults. Each should land with a
resolved-config test, a short forward-run regression, power/particle accounting,
and comparison against a published or upstream TORAX reference case.

| Priority | Addition | Recommended owner | Rationale and validation gate |
|----------|----------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Done | `sources.ohmic` for ITER and SPARC | `tokamaks/iter.yaml`, `tokamaks/sparc.yaml` | Landed at the machine-tokamak layer (standard resistive model). Resistive heating now enters the power balance wherever current is evolved. |
| Done | Bremsstrahlung and Mavrin impurity radiation backend-independent | ITER/SPARC machine-tokamak files; scenario bases retain Zeff/multipliers | Moved out of backends and into `tokamaks/iter.yaml` and `tokamaks/sparc.yaml`, closing the ITER+BgB omission. STEP keeps its tokamak-owned lumped-radiation sink (no backend brems), removing a double-count against its OpenSTEP reference. |
| Done | Cyclotron radiation (Albajar) | `tokamaks/iter.yaml`, `tokamaks/sparc.yaml` | Enabled for ITER and SPARC at the machine-tokamak layer. **Not** on STEP: its lumped `P_in_scaled_flat_profile` sink already includes synchrotron. Wall reflection is the TORAX default (0.9) pending machine calibration. |
| P1 | Replace SPARC's generic ICRF stand-in with ToricNN ICRH | Model/machine constants in `tokamaks/sparc.yaml`; power and minority mix in each SPARC scenario base | TORAX's ToricNN model is SPARC-specific and supplies species-resolved deposition. Validate supported field range, He3 composition, absorbed power, and deposition profiles before removing `generic_heat`. |
| P1 | Enable fast-ion pressure, dilution, and ITG stabilization after ICRH | Fast-ion source/composition in SPARC; stabilization switches in `qlknn.yaml` and `tglfnn*.yaml` | Restores important ICRH confinement effects. Verify that zero-fast-ion cases are unchanged and avoid double-counting fusion-alpha heating. |
| P1 | Couple the Extended Lengyel edge model | Machine constants in tokamak files; target temperature/seeding policy in scenario bases | Gives core boundary conditions and impurity seeding a physical divertor response. Start with SPARC, where compact high-power exhaust is central; validate explicit-coupling stability. |
| P2 | Enable calibrated rotation corrections | Rotation profiles/parameters in scenario bases; `use_rotation`/`rotation_mode` in TGLFNN/QLKNN backends | Adds ExB shear suppression only once toroidal rotation inputs are defensible. Do not enable a default correction with an implicit zero or guessed rotation profile. |
| Done | Fixed-duration differentiable sawtooth stepping | ITER baseline/hybrid and both SPARC scenario bases | Each RL transition now completes the configured physical interval through bounded internal PDE/event substeps, retaining crash/iteration diagnostics and reverse-mode differentiation. QLKNN's proxy remains off and inner transport patches remain surrogate OOD guards. |
| P2 | Add a direct QuaLiKiz validation backend | New validation-only backend, not a training default | Provides an offline ground-truth check for selected QLKNN states. It requires disabled JIT/file I/O and the linear solver, so it is unsuitable for vectorised RL. |
| Upstream | Predictive pedestal, heavy-impurity transport, NTM dynamics, self-consistent equilibrium | Not configurable until TORAX supplies validated models | Track as fidelity gaps rather than approximating them silently in unrelated backend knobs. |

## Reference Checks

- The resolved `step/spp_001_ec_hd/flattop` + `bohm_gyrobohm_step` pair matches
  TORAX `step_flattop_bgb.py` for the OpenSTEP BgB multiplier (`0.15`), base BgB
  coefficients, and clipping bounds. The STEP tokamak supplies its common
  neoclassical, pedestal, numerical, and randomization stack; the backend
  supplies only the selected transport and solver.
- `qlknn.yaml` uses the ITER hybrid QLKNN patch and clipping values from
  the TORAX ITER examples with a fixed-cost linear solver for rollouts/training.
- `tglfnn.yaml`, `tglfnn_nr.yaml`, and `tglfnn_spherical.yaml` share the same
  transport guards. The NR variant changes only the nonlinear solver and its
  substep budget; realistic linear and NR runs use the same TGLF transport
  uncertainty, while oracle runs use nominal values. The spherical variant
  selects the STEP-trained TGLFNN machine weights.

### KSTAR is not a TORAX backend

`envs/kstar_worldmodel.yaml` is a standalone learned-dynamics environment: a NN
ensemble trained on KSTAR discharges that emulates the 0D plasma response. Its
model name, packaged weights, horizon, and random-target switch live in the
task. Its initialization YAML stores engineering inputs, the resolved history
row repeated ten times, and target defaults/bounds. It is loaded as
`make("kstar_worldmodel")` without a backend.
