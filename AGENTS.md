# AGENTS.md

This file describes repository-specific conventions for working on `plasmax`.
User-facing installation and examples are in [README.md](README.md); testing
contracts are in [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

## Environment and commands

Use uv for every Python environment operation.

```bash
# Environment-only installed dependencies.
uv sync --no-dev

# Clone-only agents, training, plotting, and experiment dependencies.
uv sync --no-dev --group research

# Research plus tests, lint, and pre-commit.
uv sync --group dev

# ONNX conversion and artifact-generation dependencies.
uv sync --no-dev --group artifacts

uv run pytest
uv run pytest experiments/tests/
uv run pytest -m integration tests/
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
uv build
```

Use `uv run python ...` for scripts and one-liners. Never use `pip install` or a
bare `python` command. New command-line entry points use Tyro rather than
argparse.

First TORAX/JAX compilation can take minutes. Repeated calls should reuse the
JAX compilation cache.

## Package boundary

The distribution is an environment-only library. Hatch builds only
`src/plasmax/`; no repository-only module may become an installed dependency.

The supported top-level API is:

```text
make, PlasmaxConfig, PlasmaxEnv, EnvState,
TrajectoryStep, collect_episode, collect_episodes, registry
```

Keep agents, Gymnax/Rejax adaptation, programmatic training, W&B, plotting,
and studies outside `src/`. Concrete clone-only modules may be imported from a
checkout, but `agents/` and `training/` do not provide package façades.

Do not recreate the retired import namespace or a compatibility shim. Use the
lowercase brand `plasmax` in prose, paths, distribution metadata, infrastructure,
and new external identifiers. Python classes use conventional capitalization,
for example `PlasmaxEnv` and `TruncationWrapper`.

TORAX remains the upstream simulator name. Keep legitimate upstream identifiers
such as the `torax` dependency/imports, `ToraxConfig`, `_ToraxDynamics`,
`_torax_patches.py`, `torax:` YAML sections, and TORAX-owned environment
variables.

## Repository layout

```text
src/plasmax/        published environment library and packaged task data
agents/             clone-only baseline agents
training/           clone-only training launchers, adapters, and shared utilities
scripts/            generic evaluation and rollout launchers
tools/              artifact and equilibrium generation
benchmarks/         backend agreement and throughput measurements
experiments/        research studies and plotting
tests/              installed-library and integration tests
```

Study-specific behavior belongs under `experiments/`, not in a generic launcher
or the installed package. Generated run outputs and plots stay in ignored local
directories. Sweeps and manifests are intentionally local and ignored.

## Core architecture

`plasmax` wraps TORAX and the packaged KSTAR learned model behind the Envelope
explicit-state lifecycle:

1. `ControlInputs` names actuator values.
2. Internal provider appliers map them to TORAX runtime-parameter overrides.
3. `PlasmaxEnv` owns reset/transition behavior and returns `EnvState`.
4. Small Envelope wrappers add physics randomization and configured sensor/action behavior.
5. `collect_episode` and `collect_episodes` provide generic fixed-shape rollout
   collection.

Environment state and wrapper state are JAX pytrees. Preserve JIT, `lax.scan`,
`lax.while_loop`, and `vmap` compatibility. Keep the differentiable scan stepper
and event-driven while-loop stepper behaviorally aligned, including their
custom-JVP contract.

Internal TORAX physics uses its existing precision. Rewards and clone-only RL
adapters cross a float32 boundary. Do not restore global Rejax monkey patches or
copied PPO/SAC dtype workarounds; use upstream algorithms through thin adapters.

Importing `plasmax` applies `plasmax._torax_patches`. This workaround prevents a
TORAX `Grid1D.cell_widths` cached tracer from leaking between compiled traces on
EQDSK/CHEASE geometry. Keep it until the upstream issue is resolved.

## Configuration

Packaged aliases resolve paths relative to `src/plasmax/configs/` so installed
artifacts work from any current directory.

- `make` is the only public constructor. TORAX environments use
  `{tokamak}/{scenario}/{phase}` and require an explicit compatible backend;
  `kstar_worldmodel` is standalone and takes no backend. Raw YAML paths are not
  constructor inputs.
- TORAX environment fragments compose as
  `tokamak < scenario base < phase < wrappers`. Backend fragments are orthogonal:
  they own transport, solver, solver-substep budget, and transport-model
  randomization leaves, and duplicate environment/backend leaves are errors.
- YAML fragments are not independently schema-validated. The loader resolves
  assets, creates the upstream `ToraxConfig`, and validates the one complete
  `PlasmaxConfig`. KSTAR instead validates one complete `WorldModelConfig`.
- `make` validates the registered pair and options, loads the complete config,
  and returns the matching bare core environment. `RealisticWrappers` and
  `OracleWrappers` compose training behavior explicitly, check the requested
  horizon, and add final truncation.
- Keep the full registered ITER, SPARC, STEP, KSTAR, and mock matrix and every
  packaged data asset. A trajectory terminating is a control outcome, not a
  reason to remove a task.

Every leaf YAML stores task defaults:

```yaml
task:
  reward: lh_transition
```

`make` has no variant or wrapper options. Wrappers resolve defaults from the
already parsed `env.plasmax_config`; explicit wrapper arguments remain supported.
Omitted reward arguments inherit task metadata. A custom reward receives
`(state, action, next_state, termination_code)` and owns the final reward; access
the previous action through `state.prev_action`. KSTAR's native reward remains
unchanged.

Built-in TORAX rewards retain their existing objectives and soft safety barriers.
Ordinary transitions return numerically stable squareplus of the raw score;
disruption and solver failure return its logarithm, evaluated as
`asinh(score / 2)`. Invalid states return zero with zero reward-branch gradient;
sanitize invalid inputs before reward arithmetic. Initialization, reset, and
rollout-padding rewards remain zero. There is no configurable terminal penalty
or multiplier.

The core casts final rewards to float32; custom rewards are otherwise unchanged.
Nonfinite rewards pass through without an assertion or a termination-code change.
Evaluation logging reports `evaluation/nonfinite_reward_rate` over valid
transitions, excluding rollout padding. Do not sanitize rewards, add training
reward instrumentation, or enable automatic NaN checks inside simulator
arithmetic. Use ordinary JAX transformations for compiled callers and collection.

`PhysicsRandomizationWrapper` owns its RNG and samples each configured scalar
before every transition. The core consumes persistent `EnvState.phys_params`;
`with_physics` immutably updates selected entries through nested wrapper state,
and reset restores nominal values. Relative sampling uses configured nominals.
Do not change it to episode-only sampling. Keep existing sensor-noise behavior.
Do not add new noise validation, clipping,
reset-state positivity/quasineutrality gates, disruption gates, or stricter core
schema constraints.

The uv-only TGLFNN override remains in `pyproject.toml` until TORAX adopts
`fusion-surrogates` 0.4.7 and its compatible TGLFNN 0.2.0 dependency. Keep the
override index-hosted; published metadata cannot express uv overrides.

Runtime metadata uses tested lower bounds while `uv.lock` keeps clone and CI
installs exact. Do not add a TORAX upper bound without a demonstrated
incompatibility. Envelope is pre-1.0, so keep it within a tested compatible
minor series. Depend on JAX rather than duplicating its matching `jaxlib` pin.

## Tests

Tests use pytest and NumPy testing helpers. Prefer:

- `np.testing.assert_allclose` with explicit tolerances for floating results;
- `np.testing.assert_array_equal` for exact arrays and masks;
- `chex.assert_trees_all_close` for pytrees;
- `pytest.raises(..., match=...)` for error behavior.

The default `uv run pytest` command includes tests marked `integration`. CI
partitions execution explicitly: the fast job selects `not integration`, and
one integration job runs the slow specialised checks, including
external-reference parity and one representative `tglfnn_nr` canary. Keep
focused geometry, STEP, KSTAR, and fixed-duration tests in the fast suite.

The dedicated environment trajectory workflow owns the seven-way
environment/backend/variant matrix. Do not duplicate that full matrix in the
pytest integration suite.

`tests/env_trajectory_test.py` is the fast test suite for
`benchmarks/env_trajectory.py`; it must never execute the real 126-case
trajectory matrix. Use synthetic reports and mocked environments there to test
case selection, incremental output, failures, JSON validation, comparisons,
Markdown summaries, baselines, and seven-shard merging. Run real trajectories
only through the benchmark command or its dedicated GitHub Actions workflow.

Release checks build a wheel and a source distribution and run `twine check` on
them. Nothing installs or smoke-tests the built artifacts.

Do not add physical-trajectory acceptance tests or noise-validation tests.
Clone-only PPO, SAC, and MPC smoke tests should exercise upstream algorithms and
thin adapters rather than optimizer internals.

## Experiments and tracking

Run control algorithms through their dedicated repository scripts, such as
`training/train_ppo.py` and `training/train_sac.py`; do not substitute ad hoc
training runners. All transport backends except TGLFNN may be vmapped across
training seeds. Run TGLFNN seeds as independent single-seed processes or jobs.

Control-algorithm runs use online W&B logging unless the user explicitly requests otherwise. Never
silently downgrade to offline or disable logging; stop if authorization or
initialization fails.

Generic launchers inherit reward from task metadata. Pass
`--env.variant realistic` explicitly in recorded experiment commands even
though it is already the CLI default. These research labels select explicit
composition helpers in the launchers; they are not arguments to `make`.

## Release hygiene

- Track `uv.lock` and use `uv sync --locked` in CI.
- The package version starts at `0.1.0` under the clean-break name.
- Build metadata and repository links use
  `https://github.com/TheodoreWolf/plasmax`.
- `jax-envelope~=0.6.1` is the index-hosted Envelope dependency.
- Active tracked text must not contain retired branding. Immutable historical
  run identifiers belong only in ignored local manifests.
